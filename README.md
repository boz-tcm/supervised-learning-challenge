# `Columbia Engineering FinTech Bootcamp 2023-06 Cohort`

## `Project: Module 12 Supervised-Learning-Challenge`

## Background
> Credit risk poses a classification problem that is inherently imbalanced, as healthy loans easily outnumber risky loans.

## Purpose
> In this Challenge, weâ€™ll use various techniques to train and evaluate models that are characterized by imbalanced classes. We'll use an historical dataset of lending activity, sourced from a peer-to-peer lending services company, to build two models designed to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers:
1. A logistic regression model using original, unaltered raw source data; and
2. An alternative logistic regression model using the original source data but resampled to mitigate imbalanced loan health classification labels observed in the original dataset.

## Overview of the Analysis

- ### Purpose

- ### The Financial Data

- ### The Models

- ### The Modeling

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results of the Analysis

- ### Machine Learning Model 1

- ### Machine Learning Model 2

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

- ## Summary of the Analysis

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
